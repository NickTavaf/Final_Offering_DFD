            This work explores the fragmented nature of memory and testimony, 
            rendering names as particles that disperse and reform. Each interaction 
            disrupts the surface, scattering individual stories before they coalesce 
            again—a visual metaphor for how collective memory is continuously 
            shaped and reshaped. The particles respond to presence, acknowledging 
            the viewer's role in bearing witness. Through this digital memorial, 
            we confront the tension between remembering and forgetting, between 
            permanence and erasure. The names persist, returning to their positions 
            despite disruption, insisting on being seen, being counted, being remembered.
